Hi, everyone!
My name is Xiyu Yu. This is my first time to use github. I will try to use this as a part of my coding life. And I will share with you some software I programmed. Thanks.

I am very interested in probabilistic graphical model and deep learning. If you also interested in these fields, pls feel free to contact me. So we can have a discussion.
